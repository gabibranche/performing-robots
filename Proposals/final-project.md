# Final Project Proposal

## For the class:

I believe that while it is plausible, it is highly unlikely that we will all come to a consensus on what we want tp create and as such this it better to have a series of short performances.

Depending on the proposals made by my peers I would like to propose two ideas of how we could string together the different projects.

### Idea 1: The METAPERFORMANCE

The performance will begin with 'Michael' (could be a student playing Michael) giving us the task of making a performing robot. We all go off and transition to the time when we are presenting our robots. (Time lapse set up).

We then present our robot performances one by one and in between 'Michael' gives quircky remarks as feed back.

In the end he exclaims that we have all exceed his expectations and we play a hype song (eg. Celebrate Good Times) and dance with our robots.

### Idea 2: Alice in Wonderland (ish)

Similar to the first idea, the projects would be strung together by a 'protagonist' (Alice). He/she will fall into this magical land of robots and interact with the robots (and also the audience) 

For example, if Paulin makes a robot the falls in love with an audience member, it could be that Alice got scared of the robot and hid behind an audience member. The robot proceeds to ignore Alice and interact with that audience member in the way Paulin described. As the robot comes to the end of it's performance Alice could sneak past the robot and tumble into another part of robot world where it encounters Michael's slapstick robot and they interact in a comedic manner.

## For Me: My Self Cleaning House

Initially I wanted to make a robot that could play my pan and while this option is still on the table, I really liked Hatim's idea of mundane objects coming to life. I would like to work on this idea in the following way.

### The Set Up

The performance would include 5 household items
* A Broom
* A Bucket
* A Duster
* A Cleaning Cloth 
* A Mop

The 5 objects will be displayed sporatically on the stage along with a lounge chair and a table with a radio and a mirror.

### The story:

An actor will be in the chair reading a paper and when ever they are reading, one object starts to clean. When they put down the paper they stop.

The person starts to suspect that his house is alive and tries to trick the household items so that he could catch them moving. After a while he gives up and falls asleep at which point all the items start moving in a coordinated manner. While the duster is dusting the table it touches the radio which starts playing. The items move to the song playing. 

The person wakes up but the items don't realise to busy cleaning to the music. The actor looks on quitely with confusion and then looks at the audience with shock and the scene end

### The Technicalities (Brief)

* The Broom
  - The broom will be attached to a motor that will allow it to move around the room and back and forth. There will also be a thin base that gives it support.
  
* The Bucket
  - The ocket will have a base similar to that of Angelina which allows it to spin and move.
  
* The Duster
  - The duster would be suspended from the ceiling with a mechanism similar to that of JellyBot. It will be situated above the table so that it can bounce up and down 'dusting' the table

* The Cleaning Cloth
  - The cleaning cloth will be attched magnetically to a 'mirror' (probably a thinner material) behing the mirror would be a motor which moves the back magnet around causing the cloth to move at the front of the mirror.
  
* The Mop.
  - The mop will be attached to the ceiling so that it can bounce in and out of the bucket. When the bucket moves it will start mopping (using a motor) in the same spot, unitl the bucket retuns and it will go in the buckt again.
