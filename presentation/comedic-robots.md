# Robots and Comedy

## Synopsis
For my presentation on Robots, I focused on Robot Standup Comedians.The links which I presented in class can be accessed below:

[Robot Comedy Lab: experimenting with the social dynamics of live performance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4548079/)

[RoboThespians perform - I am not a robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CycD3e7UaDM)

The first link is an article which researches how robots can be used as standup comedians. 
The paper argues that comedy goes beyond the content of the joke and is highly reliant on the gestures and body language of the comedian.

The study follows the movents of a two human comedian and documents their body language, gestures and use of eye contact. 
Using the RoboThespians robot (see second link), they program the robot to mimic these gestures while performing a set and places the RoboThespian in parallel with a human comedian.

## Discussion

The results of the paper show that humans were equally amused by the robot as they were with the human. 
This may also be due to the fact that this is a novel experience but it did prove that by the use of mimetics, robots can achieve humor.
Additionally the paper concluded that the delivery of punch lines and use of gaze also greatly affected the audience

* Why is this important?

As we move forward in robotic development, robots will be penetrating all spheres of life. In terms of performance they allow for more accurate research as they can be explicitly manipulated to keep some aspects of performance constant while others can be made variables. This is not the case with living performers due to human error. If robotic performance can be achieved even in the realm of comedy, the world of performing robots will be limitless.
