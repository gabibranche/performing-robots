# Progress Report 4

## What I planned to do:

* Test and debug all robots together
* Have mop and bucket work with bluetooth
* Set up in 006
* Test with Natasha and Hatim

## What I did:

### Test and debug all robots

I tested all the robots together in the IM Lab. At this point I didn't have bluetooth working for both devices but I wanted to have a holistic picture of all 5 machines and how they would turn on and off. The broom and the Duster worked quite well and I was able to sign them off as complete. The bucket and the mop worked and just needed to be tested controlled by bluetooth. The mirror... I will come back to that.

The main issue I gathered from the test was the need for portable power sources. I had 2 power banks for the arduinos but I needed 3 more. I also needed portable power for the motors. After speaking to Michael, I was bale to geth 6V and 9V batteries packs
