# Gremlins!

My Final Project for Performing Robots was a piece called **Gremlins!**. 
<br>
It showcased 5 household items which moved on their own while the owner of the house is increasingly getting more and more startled by the mystrious occorences in the house.

<br>
**The Code** for each of the robots with comments on what the different lines of code accomplish
<br>

## Reflection

This project was very time consuming but also extremely satisfying. I learned a great deal from the process but mostly that things will work and break before your eyes and the most important aspect is to learn from the process. Thank you!
