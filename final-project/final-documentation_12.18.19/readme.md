## Overall project concept and description

**Gremlins!** was a 3 minute piece about household items which come to life. The project was inspired by Fantasia's *The Sorceror's Apprentice* which was brought up by Hatim in class. 
<br>
I decided to make 5 items:

* a broom

* a mop

* a duster
![](broom.jpg)

* a bucket
![](broom.jpg)

* a self cleaning mirror

In the performance, the items start moving one after the other but freeze whenever the owner looks up from her paper. Finally she falls asleep at which point the items all start cleaning together and moving around the room. When the owner wakes up, she is thoroughly startled.
<br>

The piece is meant to be mechanical slap stick and comedic while still showcasing the versatility of robotics.
